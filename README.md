# Description

this projest is a game that is similar to a rock-paper-scissor game but instead will have a shoot-defend-reload systeme and some set of rules to be followed. The rules will be as followed:

-You can have a max of 3 ammo.

-You cannot block more than 3 times in a row. 

-You can only shoot if you have ammo.

-Each player will have 3 lives and will go until someone reaches 0.

In the beginning of the round, a player can either choose to reload, shoot, or block. 
Reloading will fill your "gun".  Shooting will cause the other player to lose a life unless that person is blocking. If a player chooses to shoot, they lose -1 ammo. Blocking will shield the player from shots
